# Introduction 
This is a rest based api written completely from scratch in .NET core using Swagger as it's interface.

Initially written as part of a simple competition lottery based website it was never used in production but demonstrates my understanding and coding abilities.

It uses the Swashbuckle package for generating the swagger ui and a MySQL database backend.  All backend services are interfaced and inherit from an IErrorService for handling any errors.

It includes a secondary implementation Midwolf.Competitions.Api which has it's own implementation of some of the default backend services.

Please ask me any questions about this. Especially if you are interested in using it.
